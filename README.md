# Kalvium Lab | Infinite Scrolling

## Learning Goals

In this exercise, we will try to understand and implement `Infinite scrolling` using react hooks and by using a third-party library -> `infinite-scroll-component`. 
Here is an article which gives a brief description about this library. You are free to explore more about it.

[click here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component)

In react we have 2 options to implement infinite scroll in our app.
1. Using a library 
2. Implement the infinite scroll 

We will try the first way, ie: by using the existing library. 

The aim of this exercise is to -
1. How to make an infinite scrolling element. ( which is a very common feature in most of the webapps ).
2. To give an experience - as how to use a third-party library, and construct something with our existing knowledge of react.


Installing
 npm install --save react-infinite-scroll-component


### Task:

To implement infinite scrolling using react. The following gif, is what we need to achieve.

**NOTE:** This way of implementing infinite scrolling is not the only way. There are other ways too. But for this exercise, we only focussed to use some third party library. 

Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️!
